# Work Day Scheduler

## Planner Example Page by Francis Reyes

## Description
The goal of this webpage was to start out with a file example of what a daily example planner could look like. This webpage shows how something can output data stored from local storage. The data is stored in local storage, read out onto the page on refresh and has functionality based off of jQuery. The time is based off of the current time setup obtained from a js function and we can show that directly on the page using simple formatting as the current date. We also use the same function to get the current hour and base the scheduler planner around that. Then the classes are added to each row element to update it to show the current time.
